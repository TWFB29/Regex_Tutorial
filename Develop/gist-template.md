# Regex Tutorial

In this tutorial I will explain what anchors are and how they are used. Then we will preceed with an explanation of what a quantifiers are and how they are used. Next will be the OR operator we will go over what it is and how it is used. Character classes will be next on the list of things that we will go over. This will be followed by an explanation of what flags are and how they are used. Next on the list of explanations is how grouping and capturing is used and what it is. We will also be going over what bracket expressions are and how it is used. Following after that will be what greedy and lazy match is and how it is used. There will be an explanation of how boundaries are used and what they are. I will go over back-references and explain what they are and how to use them. Lastly we will explain look-ahead and look-behind and why it is important.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components
Regex is a regular expression that is wildcard based. It is used to find specific strings of text. This is done with both regular and special characters. When doing this you set a specific parameter to find or validate the specific string that you are looking for. A simple example of of this would be ^[a-z0-9_-]$. This will search for any lowercase characters, any numbers 0-9 and the special characters are an underscore and a hyphen. Now to break this down we start with the carat that is always the start of any regex expression. This is followed by the bracket that tells us that it is a range, then the a-z states that we want any lowercase letters a-z, followed by any numbers 0-9, and we follow this with the special characters which is an underscore and a hyphen. Every regex expression is closed with a dollar sign.
### Anchors
Anchors are html code that is used to create a link to a specific place on a webpage or even a completly different webpage all together. This is very usefull in making a webpage user friendly. This will allow you to skip straight to the section of the page that you are looking for. It will allow you to link to other webpages that may be related to the current one you are on. For example <a href="https://www.nfl.com">NFL</a> now to break this down, the a is the start of the anchor, followed by the href which is the refrence which is equal to the webpage you which to link to. Then we close the opening and put the string that we want to appear on the page NFL and we close our anchor </a>.
